# Authentication

The ChainPal API relies on **Bearer Token Authentication** to secure access to resources. Every API request must include a valid API key in the `Authorization` header. You can manage your API credentials within the [Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.chainpal.org/developers).

## API Keys

ChainPal provides distinct API keys for environment isolation (Live vs. Test) and client-side vs. server-side usage.

### Key Types

- **`Public Keys (pk)`**: Designed for client-side integrations (e.g., frontend widgets). These keys have restricted permissions limited to non-sensitive operations.
- **`Secret Keys (sk)`**: Designed for server-side integrations. These keys grant full access to your account and **must never be exposed in client-side code**.

### Key Prefixes

All API keys are prefixed to indicate their environment and type:

| Environment | Key Type | Prefix        |
| :---------- | :------- | :------------ |
| **Live**    | Public   | `cp_pk_live_` |
| **Live**    | Secret   | `cp_sk_live_` |
| **Test**    | Public   | `cp_pk_test_` |
| **Test**    | Secret   | `cp_sk_test_` |

## Authorization Header

Clients must send the API key in the HTTP `Authorization` header using the standardized `Bearer` scheme:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer cp_sk_test_...
```

### Example Request

``` expandable
curl https://api.chainpal.org/api/v1/payments/initialize \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer cp_sk_test_12345abcdef" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ ... }'
```

## Security Controls

### IP Whitelisting

To restrict access to your API credentials, you may configure **IP Whitelisting** in your dashboard settings. When enabled, requests originating from unauthorized IP addresses will be rejected with a `403 Forbidden` response, providing an additional layer of security for your integration.
