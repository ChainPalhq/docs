# Errors

# Error Handling

ChainPal leverages standard HTTP status codes to communicate the outcome of API requests. Errors are returned as a unified JSON object, providing both a machine-readable success flag and a human-readable message.

## HTTP Status Codes

| Code  | Status                | Description                                                                         |
| :---- | :-------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `200` | OK                    | The request finished successfully.                                                  |
| `400` | Bad Request           | The request was malformed, missing parameters, or contained invalid data.           |
| `401` | Unauthorized          | Authentication failed. The API key is missing, invalid, or expired.                 |
| `403` | Forbidden             | The authenticated client lacks permission to access the resource, or IP is blocked. |
| `404` | Not Found             | The requested resource (e.g., specific Payment ID) could not be located.            |
| `429` | Too Many Requests     | The client has exceeded the assigned rate limits.                                   |
| `500` | Internal Server Error | An unexpected server-side error occurred. Please contact support.                   |

## Error Response Structure

All error responses adhere to the following schema:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Descriptive error message here",
  "data": null
}
```

| Field     | Type      | Description                                                 |
| :-------- | :-------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `success` | `boolean` | Always `false` for error responses.                         |
| `message` | `string`  | A descriptive message detailing the cause of the error.     |
| `data`    | `null`    | Reserved for additional context; typically null for errors. |

### Example: Validation Error

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "the amount you provided is invalid, amount must be greater than zero, please try again",
  "data": null
}
```

### Example: Authentication Error

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "api key is invalid, use the format 'Bearer <api key>'",
  "data": null
}
```
