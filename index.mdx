# ChainPal Developer API

Welcome to the ChainPal Developer API documentation. ChainPal provides a RESTful API that enables businesses to accept cryptocurrency payments and receive automatic settlement in local fiat currency.

## Base URL

All API requests are made to:

```

```

## How It Works

1. **Initialize a Payment** - Create a payment session with the amount and customer details
2. **Redirect Customer** - Send your customer to the hosted checkout page
3. **Customer Pays** - Customer selects their preferred cryptocurrency and completes payment
4. **Automatic Settlement** - We convert the crypto and settle directly to your bank account
5. **Webhook Notification** - Receive real-time updates about payment status
