# ChainPal API Reference

Welcome to the ChainPal Developer Hub. ChainPal provides a robust, RESTful API infrastructure enabling seamless integration of borderless payments into your applications. By abstracting the complexities of blockchain transactions and cross-border settlements, we empower developers to build scalable financial products that bridge fiat and cryptocurrency rails.

## Architecture & Design

The ChainPal API is designed around REST principles. We enforce resource-oriented URLs, standard HTTP status codes, and JSON-encoded request and response bodies.

### Key Capabilities

- **Unified Payment Interface**: Process payments across multiple blockchains (Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Arbitrum, Base, Celo) through a single, standardized API surface.
- **Automated Settlement**: Automatically convert incoming crypto payments to local fiat currency (NGN, GHS, KES, ZAR) and settle directly to bank accounts.
- **Multi-Tenancy**: Built for scale, allowing you to manage distinct business entities and sub-accounts programmatically.
- **Webhook-Driven**: Rely on real-time event notifications to synchronize payment states with your internal systems.
