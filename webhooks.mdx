# Webhooks

Webhooks deliver real-time event notifications from ChainPal to your application. When a significant event occurs (such as a payment status change or settlement), ChainPal transmits a serialized JSON payload via an HTTP POST request to your configured endpoint.

## Configuration & Management

You can define a default webhook URL for both Live and Test environments within your [Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.chainpal.org/developers). Additionally, you may override these defaults on a per-transaction basis by supplying a `callbackURL` parameter during the payment initialization.

## Event Payload Structure

ChainPal sends a standardized JSON object for all webhook events. Your endpoint must be prepared to parse this structure.

### Example Payload

```json
{
  "event": "payment.completed",
  "data": {
    "id": "60d5ecb8b5c9c62b3c1d4e5f",
    "reference": "ORDER-12345",
    "status": "completed",
    "amount": "100.50",
    "currency": "USD",
    "token": "USDT",
    "network": "BSC",
    "txHash": "0x123abc...",
    "customerEmail": "customer@example.com",
    "metadata": {
      "orderId": "1001"
    }
  }
}
```

### Payload Fields

| Field   | Type     | Description                                                                                 |
| :------ | :------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `event` | `string` | The type of event that triggered the webhook (e.g., `payment.completed`, `payment.failed`). |
| `data`  | `object` | The resource object associated with the event (e.g., the Payment object).                   |

## Security & Verification

To ensure the integrity and authenticity of received webhooks, you should employ the following verification strategies:

1. **Signature Verification**: Verify the `X-ChainPal-Signature` header (if available) against your secret key to confirm the request originated from ChainPal.
2. **Status Reconciliation**: Upon receiving a webhook, query the `Verify Payment Status` endpoint to confirm the current state of the transaction before taking action.

_Note: Detailed signature verification guides are available in your dashboard security settings._
